# Phenotype-Disease Image Database (PDI-DB)

> **A StyleGAN3-based synthetic face generator for rare genetic disease phenotypes**

## Overview

This repository provides a **class-conditional StyleGAN3 model** trained to generate synthetic facial images representing patients with rare genetic diseases. The generated images capture disease-specific facial phenotype patterns (facial gestalt) and serve multiple purposes in computational biology and medical AI research.

**Primary Use Cases:**
- **Visualization** of disease-specific facial patterns learned from real patient data
- **Generation of synthetic training/evaluation data** for rare disease facial recognition models
- **Educational materials** and clinical teaching resources
- **Data augmentation** for downstream phenotype analysis tasks
- **Privacy-preserving research** by providing synthetic alternatives to real patient images

> ℹ️ **Important Note:** This repository focuses on **synthetic face generation** using StyleGAN3. It does not perform disease diagnosis. All generated images are fully synthetic and do not represent real patients.

## Key Features

- **Class-conditional generation** across multiple rare genetic disease categories
- **Alias-free architecture** (StyleGAN3) for improved geometric consistency
- **High-quality 224×224 resolution** synthetic faces compatible with standard computer vision pipelines
- **Controllable generation** with latent space manipulation capabilities
- **Interactive web gallery** for exploring generated samples by disease type, demographics, and other attributes

---

## Model Architecture

The model is based on **StyleGAN3** with the following key characteristics:

- **Alias-free generator** ensuring better pose consistency and geometric transformations
- **Conditional generation** supporting 10+ disease classes (configurable)
- **Training data**: Preprocessed facial images from genetic disease patient databases
- **Resolution**: 224×224 pixels (can be adjusted)
